This repository contains SQL scripts and analyses performed on the Sakila, a sample database from Oracle

## Project Overview
Sakila Analytics is part of my self-study journey to enhance my data analysis skills using SQL. 
The Sakila database, created by MySQL, is an extensive database.
Sakila features data from the parent company of two DVD rental stores, and features includes tables for movies, actors, customers, rentals, and more.

## Repository Structure

- **Sakila(Starter).sql:** Initial data requests and queries to study aggregates, inner joins, TIMESTAMPDIFF and concatenation.
- **Sakila(Analysis).sql:** Further analysis to problem solve more complex data requests.
- **Sakila(cases:procedures:functions).sql:** Study into subqueries, cases, stored proceedures and stored functions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Download the Sakila Database:** Download and install the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html) database from Oracle.

3. **Import Sakila Database:** Use the provided files to import the Sakila database into your MySQL server.
   
4. **Execute Scripts:** Open MySQL workbench, or another prefered SQL editor and execute the scripts in the repository to perform the analyses.

## Future Enhancements

- **Visualisations:** My next learning steps are to master Power Bi or Tableau to create advanced data visualisations.
- **Report Analysis:** To report detailed analysis into customer demographics and behaviour, as well as rental frequency and trends.
